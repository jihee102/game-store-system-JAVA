# game-store-system-JAVA
a simple game store inventory system / OOP with JAVA


## assignment description

> You	are	asked	to	
build	this	game	administration	system.
Beside	a	games’ name,	all	games	register	the	maximum	number	of	players	that	can	play	the	game	
simultaneously.	Also,	all	games	are	given	a	serial	number	to	allow	teachers	to	find	it	back	easily. For	
this	assignment,	you	may	assume	we	are	using	a	closet	with	infinite	storage	space and	you	do	not	
need	to	worry	about	different	shelves.
Besides	the	name,	maximum	number	of	players	and	the	location	in	the	closet,	board	games	also	
register the	publisher	of	the	game	and	any	expansions	that	have	been	bought. An	expansion	
provides	an	addition	to	a	specific game	and	does	therefore	not	have	a separate serial	number and	
will always	be	kept	next	to	the	original	game.	An	expansion	does	however	have its	own	name	and	
might	be	playable	stand-alone	(so	without	the	original	game).	This	information (name	and	
capability	of	being	played	stand-alone) also	needs	to	be	registered with	the	application.
All	card	games	are	registered	with	the	number	of	cards	that	are	included	in	the	game.	However,	for	
card	games	no	publisher	has	to	be	registered.	Also,	card	games	cannot	have	expansions.
Note: You	are	not	required	to	create	a	menu-like	interface	for	your	application

> Please note: You don’t have to make a menu or other user interfaces for the system.
